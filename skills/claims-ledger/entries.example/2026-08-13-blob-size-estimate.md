An estimate quoted as a measurement: the real figure, measured against the live store, was 1148 B,
not ~880 B. The claimant's own framing in the correction names the class precisely -- "the number I
quoted was an estimate I never checked". Cheap, self-caught, same-day, and the purest example of
the `measurement` failure mode: a number that was never the output of the measurement it implied.
